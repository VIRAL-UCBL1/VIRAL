## 🚀 Overview

**VIRAL** (Vision-grounded Integration for Reward design And Learning) provides a new approach to reward engineering, inspired by [DREFUN-V](assets/initial_idea.pdf). This project investigates how VideoLLMs (Video Large Language Models) can be used to better align reward functions with task objectives in RL settings.
