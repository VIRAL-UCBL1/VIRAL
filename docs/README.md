[![Watch the demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Hqo82CxVT38/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqo82CxVT38)

Welcome to **VIRAL** ‚Äî a framework for automatic reward function design in Gymnasium environments, leveraging the power of vision-language models to advance reinforcement learning.

## üöÄ Overview

**VIRAL** (Vision-grounded Integration for Reward design And Learning) provides a new approach to reward engineering, inspired by [DREFUN-V](assets/initial_idea.pdf). This project investigates how VideoLLMs (Video Large Language Models) can be used to better align reward functions with task objectives in RL settings.
