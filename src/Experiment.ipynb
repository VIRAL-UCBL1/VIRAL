      "\n",
      "* `vx` and `vy`: These represent the linear velocities of the lander in the x and y directions, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "* `theta`: This is the angle of the lander with respect to the horizontal plane, which can range from `-6.2831855` (π radians) to `10`. Note that this range seems inconsistent; typically, angles would be defined within a single period of 2π or π radians for simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "* `omega`: This represents the angular velocity of the lander around its vertical axis.\n",

      "1. **Vertical Velocity Control**: The agent needs to control the vertical velocity (`vy`) to zero to prevent descending and maintain the current altitude. This involves regulating `vy` within a small range around zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Horizontal Positioning**: For stationary flight, the horizontal movement should be minimized or ideally controlled at a constant speed to maintain position over time. This involves keeping `vx` close to zero but with some tolerance depending on the desired hovering stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Altitude Maintenance (Preventing Landing)**: The agent must avoid letting the lander descend further than its current altitude by controlling `theta`, ensuring that `vy` does not become negative (indicating descent). This involves keeping the vertical velocity component of the movement in check, often done through fine adjustments to `theta`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Angular Velocity and Orientation**: For a stationary flight without drifting away from the desired position or orientation, managing `omega` is crucial. The agent must stabilize the lander's angular velocity around its vertical axis to prevent unwanted turns.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Leg Contact Avoidance (Preventing Landing)**: The agent should ensure that at least one leg remains in contact with the ground (`leg1_contact` and/or `leg2_contact`) but avoid conditions where both legs are on the ground, which would cause landing. This involves understanding the dynamics of each leg's interaction with the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve these goals, the reinforcement learning algorithm can utilize a reward function that penalizes large deviations in any dimension (especially altitude, vertical velocity, and angular velocity), while encouraging steady states or small movements towards maintaining stationarity in flight."

      "The observation space described is an 8-dimensional vector that represents the state of the lander in various aspects. Let's break down each dimension:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **x & y coordinates**: The position of the lander in the x and y directions, respectively.\n",
      "2. **Linear velocities (vx & vy)**: The speed at which the lander is moving in the x and y directions, respectively.\n",
      "3. **Angle (θ)**: The orientation of the lander's body, measured from the x-axis counterclockwise.\n",
      "4. **Angular velocity (ω)**: The rate of change of the angle, representing how quickly the lander is rotating.\n",
      "5. **Leg contact (left & right legs)**: Two binary values indicating whether each leg is in contact with the ground or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve a stationary flight without landing or crashing, the agent must navigate the lander to a stable equilibrium point while maintaining airspeed and avoiding ground impact. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial state**: The lander starts at a random location with an initial velocity. The agent must quickly assess the situation and adjust its control inputs.\n",
      "2. **Airspeed stabilization**: By adjusting the thrusters, the agent can try to stabilize the airspeed (vx & vy) as close to zero as possible. This is crucial for maintaining flight.\n",
      "3. **Angle adjustment**: The agent must also adjust the angle (θ) of the lander's body to ensure that it remains parallel to the horizon. This will help maintain airspeed and prevent crashes.\n",
      "4. **Angular velocity reduction**: As the airspeed stabilizes, the angular velocity (ω) should be minimized to prevent spinning.\n",
      "5. **Leg contact management**: The agent must carefully manage leg contact with the ground. Since the goal is not to land, the agent should avoid touching down on either leg. If a leg touches the ground, it should immediately lift off before the other leg does.\n",
      "6. **Continuous control adjustments**: Throughout the process, the agent will need to make continuous control adjustments to maintain airspeed, angle, and angular velocity stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, achieving stationary flight without landing or crashing requires the agent to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Stabilize airspeed\n",
      "* Adjust angle to horizon\n",
      "* Minimize angular velocity\n",
      "* Manage leg contact with ground\n",

      "To solve this problem using reinforcement learning, a suitable approach would be to use a deep Q-Network (DQN) with a carefully designed reward function that encourages the agent to achieve these goals."

      "* Once stabilized, the agent can begin moving horizontally within a small range (e.g., `x` coordinate between -1 and 1).\n",
      "* To maintain a constant speed and direction, the agent should continuously monitor its linear velocities (`vx` and `vy`) and adjust them accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 3: Stationary Flight**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The key to achieving stationary flight lies in maintaining a constant altitude while avoiding any forward or backward movement.\n",
      "* To do this, the agent should:\n",
      "\t+ Continuously adjust its angle (`theta`) to maintain an upward orientation.\n",
      "\t+ Regulate its angular velocity to zero to prevent rotation.\n",
      "\t+ Monitor its vertical velocity (`vy`) and adjust it to maintain a stable altitude.\n",
      "\t+ Ensure that at least one leg is always in contact with the ground (boolean `leg_contact_1` or `leg_contact_2` remains 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 4: Avoid Crashing/Landing**\n",
      "\n",
      "* To avoid crashing or landing, the agent must continuously monitor its distance from the ground and adjust its position (`x`, `y`) to maintain a safe altitude.\n",
      "* The agent should also be prepared to rapidly change its movement or orientation in response to any unexpected changes in the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully controlling these variables, the agent can successfully achieve stationary flight within this challenging environment."

      "To achieve stationary flight without landing but also avoiding a crash, the agent must balance multiple constraints. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Control Angle (`theta`)**: To maintain a stable flight, the agent should control the angle `theta` to keep the lander's horizontal velocity (`vy`) near zero. This can be achieved by adjusting the thrust and pitch forces applied to the lander.\n",
      "2. **Control Linear Velocity (`vx`, `vy`)**: The agent must balance the linear velocities to maintain a stable flight trajectory. To avoid landing, it should ensure that the vertical component of velocity (`vy`) remains positive (i.e., upward motion). For stationary flight, both horizontal and vertical components of velocity should be close to zero.\n",
      "3. **Control Angular Velocity (`omega`)**: The agent should control the angular velocity `omega` to maintain a stable rotation around its axis. A low but non-zero angular velocity can help stabilize the lander's attitude.\n",
      "4. **Contact with Ground (Legs)**: To avoid landing, the agent must ensure that both legs are not in contact with the ground simultaneously (`leg1_contact` and `leg2_contact` booleans). This can be achieved by controlling the height of the lander above the ground.\n",
      "5. **Altitude Control**: The agent should control the altitude of the lander to maintain a stable flight trajectory. By adjusting the thrust force, it can increase or decrease the altitude.\n",
      "6. **Stationary Flight Conditions**:\n",
      "\t* `vx` and `vy` should be close to zero (i.e., minimal horizontal and vertical motion)\n",
      "\t* `theta` should be constant, maintaining a stable angle\n",
      "\t* `omega` should be low but non-zero for stability\n",
      "\n",
      "**Control Strategy**: The agent can use the following control strategy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Determine desired velocity**: Set `vx`, `vy`, and `theta` to their desired values.\n",
      "2. **Calculate thrust forces**: Use the desired velocities and angle to calculate the required thrust forces (in x, y, and pitch directions).\n",
      "3. **Apply controls**: Apply the calculated thrust forces to control the lander's movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reward Function**: To encourage stationary flight, a suitable reward function could be designed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reward `R` for each time step: `R = 1 - (|vx| + |vy|) / (2 * delta_t)`, where `delta_t` is the time step size. This encourages minimal horizontal and vertical motion.\n",
      "* Penalty `-P` if the lander lands or crashes (`leg1_contact` and/or `leg2_contact` simultaneously).\n",
      "\n",
      "This reward function can be adjusted and combined with other metrics to fine-tune the agent's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Notes**: Achieving stationary flight in this environment is challenging due to the need to balance multiple constraints. The agent must carefully control its velocity, angle, and angular velocity while avoiding landing or crashing.\n",

      "    *   Coordinates of the lander in x & y axes\n",
      "    *   Linear velocities in x & y axes\n",

      "    *   Angular velocity (rate of rotation)\n",
      "    *   Two boolean values indicating contact with each leg on the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Red Annotation Interpretation\n",
      "\n",
      "The red annotation \"STATIONARY FLIGHT\" indicates a specific goal for the agent. It suggests that instead of landing or crashing, the agent should maintain a stationary position in flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Scientific Knowledge Application\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this goal, consider the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Maintain Angle and Angular Velocity:** The agent must control its angle (rotation) and angular velocity to stabilize itself in mid-air without rotation.\n",
      "2.  **Balance Velocities:** Ensure linear velocities are minimized or set to zero if possible, to prevent movement towards landing or crashing.\n",
      "3.  **Leg Contact Management:** Manage boolean values related to leg contact by lifting them off the ground when necessary to avoid landing and ensure free flight.\n",
      "4.  **Continuous Feedback Loop:** The agent needs a continuous feedback loop from sensors or observations about its state and position relative to the ground to make adjustments in real-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving stationary flight involves maintaining stability, balancing movements, and strategically managing leg contact. By leveraging precise control over angle, angular velocity, and linear velocities, the agent can successfully accomplish the goal of stationary flight without landing or crashing."

      "1.  **Maintain stable torso height**: The z-coordinate of the torso (dimension 0) should be kept relatively low to avoid unnecessary high jumps.\n",
      "2.  **Control angular velocities**: The angular velocities of joints (dimensions 7-10) play a crucial role in determining the robot's movements. The agent must carefully modulate these values to achieve smooth and efficient motion.\n",
      "3.  **Monitor velocity and acceleration**: Dimensions 5, 6, and 8-10 provide information about the robot's velocity and acceleration. By monitoring these variables, the agent can adjust its control inputs to prevent excessive speed or acceleration.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve the goal of fast-forwarding without jumping too high, the agent could use the following strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Maintain a moderate torso height**: Set the z-coordinate of the torso (dimension 0) around 1-2 units. This will allow for efficient movement while minimizing unnecessary high jumps.\n",
      "*   **Smoothly adjust angular velocities**: Gradually increase or decrease the angular velocities of joints to achieve smooth and controlled motion.\n",
      "*   **Monitor velocity and acceleration**: Keep track of the robot's velocity and acceleration, adjusting control inputs as needed to maintain a stable and efficient pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully balancing these variables and using the insights above, the agent can successfully navigate the environment while achieving its goal."

      "2. **Control thigh joint**: The agent needs to control the thigh joint to maintain a consistent stride length. This can be achieved by setting the thigh hinge angle to a moderate value (e.g., around 50-70 degrees).\n",
      "3. **Leg joint control**: The leg joint should be controlled to maintain a stable and efficient gait. The agent should aim for a moderate leg joint angle (e.g., around 30-50 degrees).\n",
      "4. **Foot joint control**: The foot joint should be controlled to ensure smooth touchdown and push-off. The agent can achieve this by setting the foot hinge angle to a small value (e.g., around -20 to 20 degrees).\n",
      "5. **Velocity control**: The agent needs to control its velocity to maintain a fast-forwarding motion without jumping too high. This can be achieved by adjusting the velocity of the x-coordinate and z-coordinate of the torso.\n",
      "6. **Angular velocity control**: The agent should control its angular velocities to maintain stability and balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve these goals, the agent can use reinforcement learning algorithms such as policy gradient methods or actor-critic methods. The reward function can be designed to encourage fast-forwarding while penalizing high heights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some possible rewards functions could include:\n",

      "* +1 for maintaining a constant torso angle\n",
      "* +0.5 for controlling the thigh joint within a moderate range\n",

      "* -1 for losing balance or falling\n",

      "In addition, techniques such as **Curriculum Learning** can be used to gradually increase the difficulty of the task by introducing new challenges, such as obstacles or changes in terrain. This can help the agent learn more efficiently and adapt to different scenarios.\n",

      "Finally, using techniques from **Robotics and Motor Control**, such as **PD control** (Proportional-Derivative control) or **PID control** (Proportional-Integral-Derivative control), can be used to improve the stability and efficiency of the agent's movements. These methods can help the agent learn more robust policies that are less sensitive to disturbances.\n",

      "3. **Control the torso angle:** The agent can control the angular velocity of the torso angle (dimension 1). By adjusting this velocity, the robot can change its direction and speed while maintaining a relatively constant height. The agent should aim for an angular velocity that allows the robot to move forward while minimizing changes in z-coordinate.\n",
      "4. **Use foot and leg joints:** To control the vertical movement, the agent can use the angles of the foot and leg joints (dimensions 3-4). By adjusting these angles, the robot can adjust its center of gravity and maintain balance while moving forward.\n",
      "5. **Minimize excessive height:** To avoid jumping too high, the agent should monitor the z-coordinate and adjust the control inputs to prevent significant changes in height.\n",

      "Minimize the squared difference between the current z-coordinate (`z_current`) and the target z-coordinate (`z_target`), while keeping the x-coordinate (`x_current`) as close as possible to its initial value (`x_init`). We also add a penalty term for excessive height (i.e., when `z_current > z_max`).\n",

      "3. **Adjust thigh and leg joint angles**: To achieve fast forward movement, the agent should set the thigh and leg joint angles to values that allow for efficient stride extension (around -50 to 50 radians). This will enable the robot to move quickly while minimizing jumping.\n",
      "4. **Regulate foot joint angle**: The agent should control the foot joint angle to maintain a stable footing, preventing excessive slipping or loss of balance (-100 to 100 radians).\n",
      "5. **Modulate velocity**: To fine-tune its movement, the agent should adjust its horizontal and vertical velocities to optimize speed while minimizing jumping. For example, it can decrease the z-coordinate velocity (height) to prevent unnecessary upward motion.\n",
      "6. **Monitor and adapt**: The agent must constantly monitor its position and velocity, adjusting its controls as necessary to maintain a balance between fast forward movement and minimal jumping.\n",
      "\n",

However, please note that this is a high-level outline, and the actual implementation may require additional refinements based on specific environment details and control mechanisms.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here are some steps the agent could take:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Initial Setup**: The agent starts by setting up the initial conditions for the pendulum and cart. This includes setting the initial position, velocity, and forces applied to the cart.\n",
      "2.  **Observation Collection**: The agent collects observations from the environment, including the position and velocity of the pendulum and cart.\n",
      "3.  **Policy Selection**: Based on the collected observations, the agent selects an action (force) to apply to the cart. This is done using a policy network that takes into account the current state of the system.\n",
      "4.  **Action Execution**: The selected force is applied to the cart, causing it to move and potentially affecting the pendulum's motion.\n",
      "5.  **Reward Collection**: After executing the action, the agent collects a reward signal based on its performance. For example, if the pendulum remains upright and the cart moves forward quickly, the agent receives a positive reward.\n",
      "6.  **Update Policy**: The agent updates its policy network using the collected rewards and observations. This process is repeated multiple times to learn an optimal policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve fast forward without jumping too high, the agent needs to balance its actions carefully. If it applies too much force to the cart, the pendulum may jump up, reducing the reward. On the other hand, if it applies too little force, the cart may not move forward quickly enough, also reducing the reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Tips**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Proper Observations**: The agent needs accurate and complete observations of the system's state in order to make informed decisions.\n",
      "*   **Careful Reward Engineering**: The reward function should be carefully designed to encourage the desired behavior. In this case, a reward function that penalizes excessive jumping or slow cart movement would be appropriate.\n",
      "*   **Useful Exploration Strategies**: The agent needs to explore its environment effectively to learn about the system's dynamics and discover optimal policies.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Break Down the Observation Space\n",
      "\n",
      "The observation space consists of two main parts:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **qpos (5 elements):** Position values of the robot's body parts.\n",
      "*   **qvel (6 elements):** The velocities of these individual body parts (their derivatives).\n",

      "## Step 3: Identify Key Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "From the observation space, we can identify key observations that would be relevant to the goal of fast forwarding without jumping too high:\n",

      "To achieve the goal of fast forwarding without jumping too high, the agent would need to learn a policy that optimizes for forward movement while keeping the height of the hopper within a certain range. This could be done by adjusting the joint angles and velocities in a way that minimizes the height of the hopper while maximizing forward progress.\n",
