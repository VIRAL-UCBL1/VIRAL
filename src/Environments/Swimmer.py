The observation space consists of the following elements (in order):
- qpos (3 elements by default): Position values of the robotâ€™s body parts.
- qvel (5 elements): Velocities of these body parts (their derivatives).

By default, the observation does not include the x- and y-coordinates of the front end. These can be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction. In this case, the observation space will be `Box(-Inf, Inf, (10,), float64)`, where the first two observations are the x- and y-coordinates of the front end. Regardless of the value of `exclude_current_positions_from_observation`, the x- and y-coordinates are returned in `info` with the keys "x_position" and "y_position", respectively.

By default, the observation space is `Box(-Inf, Inf, (8,), float64)` with the following elements:

| Num | Observation                                | Min  | Max  | Type                   |
