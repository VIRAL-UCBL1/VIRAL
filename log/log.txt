### Explanation:
- **Reward for Steps**: The function gives a reward of +1 for every step taken by the agent.
- **Termination and Truncation**: If the episode terminates (pole falls off) or is truncated (episode reaches a maximum length), the reward is set to -1, indicating an unsuccessful outcome.

### Logic Explanation:
- **Reward Calculation**: The function starts by setting a default reward of `+1` for each step taken.
- **Pole Angle Penalty**: If the pole angle exceeds ±24°, a penalty of `-2` is applied to discourage the pole from tipping over.
- **Termination Check**: If the episode terminates, it checks if the cart's position and velocity are within acceptable limits (within -1.2 to 1.2 for horizontal position and less than or equal to 0.045 for vertical velocity) and if the pole angle is less than ±5°. If these conditions are met, the reward is set to `500`, indicating a successful landing. Otherwise, a penalty of `-100` is applied.
- **Truncated Episode**: If the episode is truncated (e.g., due to reaching a time limit), a penalty of `-10` is applied.

This function aims to encourage the agent to keep the pole upright for as long as possible while penalizing unfavorable states and terminating episodes that do not meet success criteria.

**Comment:** This reward function provides a simple positive reward for each step taken in the environment. It penalizes the agent by subtracting 100 points if the episode terminates or gets truncated, which helps to encourage the agent to avoid failure and continue the episode as long as possible.
